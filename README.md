How good is your memory?

Click the buttons in the order they appear, but beware! Only the most recent button in the sequence will be shown as the levels progress. The rest is up to your memory. Can you do better than the average of 11 levels. Good luck!

Future changes/ideas that i might implement:

  -an additional box added every 3-5 levels.
  -better delay between the levels for a smoother playing experience.
  -leaderboards to get bragging rights to your friends.
